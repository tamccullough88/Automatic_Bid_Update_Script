Actual_Google_Bid_Export_Script.js is what is currently being used to export the bids to a google sheet, where I am currently doing the calculation for the bids. 

the test_google_ads_script.js is where I am working on the logic to see where the issues are coming from in the bid updates from js. 
This, unfortunately, needs to be done in js since the google ads scrits are a js framework, otherwise I would use python or c# to do this.
